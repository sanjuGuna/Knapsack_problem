# Knapsack Problem Solver with Visualization

This project implements the classic **0/1 Knapsack Problem** using two approaches:

- **Top-Down (Memoization)**
- **Bottom-Up (Dynamic Programming)**

It provides an interactive **Streamlit** web app to input problem parameters, visualize the dynamic programming table filling process, and measure the runtime performance of each method.

---

## Features

- Clear implementations of Top-Down and Bottom-Up knapsack algorithms.
- Real-time interactive visualization of the DP table construction.
- Execution time measurement for algorithm performance comparison.
- User-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit.
- Easy input of weights, values, and knapsack capacity.
